# `dumpster`: A cycle-tracking garbage collector for Rust

`dumpster` is an experimental garbage-collector for Rust.
It detects unreachable allocations and automatically frees them.

This project is still highly unstable and in development, so documentation may be scarce.
Additionally, I'm keeping it quiet for now (sssssh!) but will create a full write-up on how this
works when it's ready for release.
